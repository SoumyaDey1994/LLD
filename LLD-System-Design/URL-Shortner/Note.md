# URL Shortener – Problem Statement

```
Design a URL shortener that converts a long URL into a short, unique code and resolves it back to the original URL.

The system must support pluggable short-code generation strategies, injected at runtime, to avoid tight coupling.

Each shortened URL should have a configurable expiry time (default 1 minute) and be stored in memory.

The design should emphasize clean low-level design, extensibility, and correctness.
