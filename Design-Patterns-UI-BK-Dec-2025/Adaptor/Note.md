## Adapter Design Pattern

### Category: Structural

### Purpose: Convert one interface into another interface that the client expects, allowing incompatible components/classes to work together.

### Best use-case: 

    -- Integrating legacy code with new code

    -- Wrapping external libraries to match your app’s API

    -- Providing a unified interface over inconsistent data sources

    -- Translating inputs/outputs between systems

### Frontend use-cae: Adapter for UI Component Behavior

### Backend use-case: Adapter for Payment Providers
