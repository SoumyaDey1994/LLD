## Factory Design Pattern


### Category: Creational

### Purpose: Create objects without exposing the creation logic, and return objects through a common interface.

### Best use-case: When object creation varies by type, configuration, or environment (e.g., different UI widgets, different service clients).


### Frontend use-cae: UI Component Factory (Buttons for themes)

### Backend use-case: Payment Processor Factory
