## Abstract Factory Design Pattern

### Category: Creational

### Purpose: Provide an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.

### Best use-case: When you need interchangeable product families (e.g., a set of UI components that must match a theme, or related backend clients/handlers for different providers).

### Frontend use-case: Themed Component Abstract Factory (Button + Dropdown)

### Backend use-case: Payment Abstract Factory (Payment Client + Webhook Handler)
