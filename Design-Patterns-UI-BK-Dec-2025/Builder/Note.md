## Builder Design Pattern

### Category: Creational

### Purpose: Construct complex objects step-by-step, allowing different representations using the same construction process.

### Best use-case: 
    ```
        When an object has many optional parameters

        To avoid large constructors or confusing config objects

        When object creation needs to be readable and controlled
    ```

### Frontend use-cae: Button Builder (styles, hover, icon)

### Backend use-case: Request Builder (HTTP Request)
