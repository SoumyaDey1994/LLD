# Parking Lot – Problem Statement

```
Design a parking lot system that supports parking and un-parking of vehicles of different types (e.g., car, bike, truck).
The system should manage multiple floors and parking slots, allocate the nearest available suitable slot, and track slot availability in real time.
It should generate a parking ticket on entry and calculate parking fees on exit based on duration and vehicle type.
The design should focus on clean object modeling, extensibility, and correctness.
