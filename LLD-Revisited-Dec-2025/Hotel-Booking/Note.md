# Hotel Booking System – Problem Statement

```
Design a hotel booking system that allows users to search hotels and rooms, check availability for a date range, and book or cancel reservations.

The system should support different room types, pricing per night, and booking status management.

It must prevent double booking for the same room and date range.

The design should emphasize clean low-level design, extensibility, and correctness.
