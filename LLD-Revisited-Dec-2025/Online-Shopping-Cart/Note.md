# Online Shopping Cart – Problem Statement

```
Design a shopping cart system that allows users to add, update, remove, and view items in their cart.
The cart should correctly handle item quantities, pricing, and total cost calculation, including updates when items change.
Each user should have an independent cart, maintained in memory for the session.
The design should emphasize clean low-level design, extensibility, and correctness.
